# GoLang Practice Exercises

This is my **GoLang Practice Exercises** repository. This repository contains a collection of practice exercises designed to help me solidify my understanding of Go programming concepts. The exercises are based on the "Let's Go with GoLang" YouTube series and other practice materials.

## YouTube Series

The exercises in the `lets-go-with-golang` folder are directly linked to the lessons from the "Let's Go with GoLang" YouTube series. The series is available on [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAV69dS1uWQGDQoBYMZWKjzuhCaOnBpa). Each exercise is meant to be completed after watching the corresponding video.
